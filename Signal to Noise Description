Python program name:     signal_noise.py

Program function:     Calculate the signal to noise ratio for a specific telescope and target object.
                      Also, calculate the signal to noise ratio taking into account more advanced topics like quantum efficiency.

Program command line arguments:    
          
          signal_noise.py diameter, exposure, throughput, airmass, magnitude, pixel scale, number of pixels, % light pixels, 
          quantum efficiency, dark current, readout noise
          
where diameter is diameter of telescope in meters, exposure time is in minutes, throughput of telescope, airmass of the observation,
magnitude of the target object, pixel scale of object in arcseconds, number of pixels that make up photometric apeture, and fraction 
of light source in those pixels, quantum effiency of telescope, dark current in camera in units of electrons/sec, readout noise in electrons

The program outputs the standard signal to noise ratio as well as the advanced signal to noise ratio taking into account quantum efficiency,
dark current, and readout noise.


Example:     For supernova observed in the R band, with the following command line arguments, the signal to noise ratio is 43
             and the updated signal to noise ratio is 40.5
             
             Command line arguments:

             python signal_noise.py 1.2 1 0.8 1.0 20 1 4 0.9 0.9 0.01 5
             
             Therefore, a telescope diameter of 1.2 meters, exposure time of 1 minute, throughput of 0.8, airmass of 1.0, magnitude of 20,
             pixel scale of 1 arcsecond/pixel, pixel area of 4 pixels^2, pixel fraction of 0.9, quantum efficiency of 0.9, dark current of 
             0.01 electrons/second, and a readout of 5 electrons.
