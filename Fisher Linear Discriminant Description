Program functions:     Given two data sets corresponding to two different hypotheses, labeled as f_0 and f_1, calculate the means and
covariance matrices.  In addition, use the Fisher linear discriminant technique to construct a test statistic, t(x) = transpose(a)x.  Python
solves for the coefficients a=[a_1,a_2,a_3], calculates the meabns and covariances of the transformed basis and calculates the normally
distributed distributions g(t|H_0) and g(t|H_1) (seen in "Distributions" graph where globular cluster = g(t|H_0) and open cluster = g(t|H_1))
where H_0 and H_1 are the two hypothesis.  Using the mean values and the standard deviations, python calcuates the significance evel of 
the test (the probability one would classify the event as a globular cluster), and calculate the power of the test.
