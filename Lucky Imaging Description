Python program name:     atmosphere_lucky_imaging.py

Program function:     Given a fits file containing multiple frames of a single image (object HD73871), add all of the frames together.
Find the brightest pixel for the added frames, as well as the total light for all frames.  Using those two numbers, calculate the Strehl ratio,
which is proportional to the brightest_pixel/total_light.  Calculate the Strehl ratio for each frame and make a histogram of all the Strehl ratios.
After automatically aligning the frames, find the Strehl ratio for the aligned frames.  Keep the frames that have the top 5% Strehl ratios and align those images.

Program command line arguments:    
          
         atmosphere_lucky_imaging.py
          


The program outputs multiple Strehl ratios, as well as the brightest pixel value and the total light for the aligned frames. 
The program produces fits files for the added_frames, aligned_added_frames, and the aligned_added_frames for the top 5% of Strehl ratios.
In addition, it plots a histogram of the Strehl ratios for all the frames.  This histogram is saved as "Strehl_ratio.png".

Output:      hd73871_added_frames.fits  ;  hd73871_aligned_added_frames.fits  ;  hd73871_top_5%_aligned_added_frames.fits
