Python program name:     spectroscopy.py

Program function:     Reduce data from UNC Resolve survey, taken using the Goodman spectograph on SOAR. Looking at a galaxy, the spectograph
measures a small slit of the galaxy's spectrum.  First, I calibrate the data using the biases from the RESOLVE survey and combine the images
to make one final image and spectrum of the galaxy.  Next, I find the y-position of the galaxy as a function of x-position on the chip, and
fit a 3rd order polynomial, which represents where the galaxy is on the chip (seen in the "Maximum Light with Polynomial" graph).  Using the
polynomial fit, extract the light in the spectrum not taking into account background calibration (seen in the "Extracted Spectrum" graph).
Next, calibrate the spectrum using the background calibration (seen in "Spectrum Minus Background" graph).  Next, find the spectrum of the
calibration lamp and fit another polynomial to the calibration lamp spectrum (seen in "Lamp Spectrum" graph).  Using the calibration lamp
spectrum polynomial fit, translate the x-values for extracted spectrum for the galaxy into wavelengths (seen in "Final Spectrum" graph).
Calculated the redshift of the galaxy, which is 0.021 and calculate the redshift error (seen in "Redshift Error" graph).  Finally, we extract
the spectrum at three different places (seen in "200/400/600 Slice" graphs), from which we can calculate the rotation curve of the galaxy.


Program command line arguments:    
          
          spectroscopy.py bias.fits Calibration_Lamb.fits galaxy_spectrum.fits

Example:    spectroscopy.py Spectroscopy_Data/*.ZERO.fits Spectroscopy_Data/0317.HgAr.fits Spectroscopy_Data/*.rs0625bspec.fits

where *.ZERO.fits are the biases from the RESOLVE survey, 0317.HgAr.fits is the spectrum for a mercury argon calibration lamp, and *.rs0625bspec.fits are the galaxy spectrum.
