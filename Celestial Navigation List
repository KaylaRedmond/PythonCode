Python program name:     celestial_navigation_list.py

Program function:     Plots the altitude of multiple targets over 24 hours as observed from a particular observing site on particular date

Program command line arguments:     
          
          celestial_navigation.py year month day obs_long obs_lat

where obs_long is the observing longitude, obs_lat is the observing latitude

This program reads in multiple targets Right Ascensions and Declinations from a file titled "Target_Altitudes.txt"

Example:     Plot titled "SOAR Altitude Graph Multiple Targets" is the output of this program using the following command line arguments

             celestial_navigation_list.py 2015 09 01 273.0 32.0
             
There are also multiple tables outside the graph which label which times a given target is above an airmass of 2.0
