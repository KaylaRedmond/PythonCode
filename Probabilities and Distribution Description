Program function:     

Probabilities:     Five people flip a fair coin, and the "odd person out" - meaning that all but one have coins with the same face 
showing, while the odd person out has the opposite face, wins the game.  Simulate 2000 games, calculate the average number of flips 
required for the odd person out to win (around 3 flips), and plot the flip distribution for the 2000 games (seen in "Fair Coin Distribution" graph).
Re-run code if one person has a biased coin, where heads appears with a probability of 0.3 and tails with 0.7.  With a biased coin for 2000
simulations, the average number of flips required for the odd person out to win is around 6, and replot the flip distribution
(seen in "Bias Coin Distribution" graph).

Distributions:     Generate computer plots of the Binomial and Poisson distributions for p = 0.35 N = 4, and p = 0.35 N = 40.  Overlaid 
over those distributions are Gaussian distributions that give the best approximation to the Binomial or Poisson distribution
(seen in "Binomial Distribution" and "Poisson Distribution" graphs).
