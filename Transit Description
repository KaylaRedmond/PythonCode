Python program name:     photometry.py

Program function:     Read in raw telescope data of an exoplanet transit, calibrate images using biases, darks, and a flat image.  Reduce all of the images in one program. 
Perform background-subtracted aperture photometry.  Aperture photometry = measuring the total amount of light in a fixed circular region around the star's position.
Background-subtracted = estimating the local background behind the stars by drawing a large circular annulus around them, calculating the median pixel value
in that annulus, and use that estimate the background in the aperture.  Therefore, we subtract the background light from our images and use aperture photometry
to measure the brightness of the target star and reference star.  Using the reference star brightness, we calibrate the target star brightness and remove systematic
effects.  After calibrating the images, we bin the images so we can see the transit.


Program command line arguments:    
          
          python photometry.py
          

The program outputs five graphs and two fits files which are used to make images of the transit in ds9 (astronomical software).

Output:      
Graphs:     "UnCalibrated Target Brightness Over Time"  ;  "First Reference Brightness Over Time"  ;  "Second Reference Brightness Over Time"  ;
            "Calibrated Brightness Over Time"  ;  "Binned Calibrated Brightness Over Time"
Fits:       "Transit after calibration.fits"  ;  "Aperture.fits"



Example:     For star wasp77ab, we take the images in the Green filter, and after calibrating the images we see the exoplanet transit across this star
             as seen in the "Binned Calibrated Brightness Over Time" graph.
